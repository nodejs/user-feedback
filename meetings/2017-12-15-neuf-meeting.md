**TOPIC**

## Notes
	* We have a list of folks engaged in providing feedback data with help from Foundation team 
	* We have user-feedback@nodejs.org. email setup.**Thank you, Michael** 
	* With the Benchmarking team survey still on, we will keep the meeting on 12.29.2017 
  **Thank you Tierney** for helping us setting the meeting)
  * Highlights from Greg Wallace, **many thanks Greg**:
    * Right now, we are doing the third annual user survey run by the Foundation useful 
  for community too (beginning with 2015- around 700 responses, 2016 around 1400 responses 
  and now the third one still running, more than 1500 responses at this time).
  Statistically significant as a sample.
     * The survey is completely anonymous with the option that if you willing to be contacted by the Foundation,
       you may provide email address. We have a good number after each survey with good technical detail; from end-users
       
     * For the surveys closed (2015 and 2016) we need information from the responses.
     
     * Issue: in open-ended questions when we have open /free text it’s hard to identify trends, 
     unless you are a very good in analyzing data. Polly, the researcher, recommended that wherever possible that may
     change into “closed questions” -that means a list a series of options to pick from.
     It’s very possible that a percentage will respond in a way that isn’t provided among the list we come up with,
     so you always must have another category. If we know the subject,
     you usually get 95-98% of respondents who find the options in the multiple-choice list that you provide.
     
     * If you want a handful of highly targeted responses, then this it should be into our promotional strategy
     
Comment: (need a list/email that Greg will provide to us).
 
Question(Mihai): Why is the survey bilingual?
Answer(Greg): The users from China significantly increase responses and we offered the questions in Chinese. Running different surveys in several languages in Survey Monkey currently results in multiple data sets. We got great help from China translating the questions.

Question (Diego) Can we have data results to run our own analysis?
Answer (Dan) Yes, Greg will provide us the data and we’re going to posted in user-feedback repo

Question(Tierney) How the company name would be anonymized? Do we think, including company name, matters or not?

(Dan)In January 12, 2018 we will have an initial feedback session with the output that companies who’ve recently choose Node.js or evaluating 


**Closing Thoughts**
- [Tierney] Expressed concerns about how the Enterprise Advisory Group has been added to the responsibilities of the Node.js End User Feedback Initiative and therefore the CommComm without notifying the CommComm of its purpose and that actions were being taken.
