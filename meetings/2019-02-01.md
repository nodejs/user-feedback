## Q&A, Other
### Notes:
* Follow-up the meeting:6 new issues: #119,...,#124
* Links: https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule 
* Dan: Update from Joe Sepi: he reached out Matteo to finish the survey, and my feedback is, let’s try to align to the current: 
* Current and past members survey: this is behind other surveys  release. 
* Michael: I guess the question is timeliness, is there a time factor in terms of we’re proposing already the individual membership
  program is part of the joint Foundation? I don’t think we’re going to wait for the survey at this point, unless we could get 
  the survey turned around in a few weeks; it doesn’t mean that it’s still not worthwhile it might be something like we time with the
  launch of the new program or it’s a checkpoint along the way for implementing that new program.
* Dan: this issue will be on Comm-Comm agenda next week
* Issue 82: Node.js meet-up: the release date for the current is end of April, so on May 2- San Francisco Node (thirst Thursday)
   I’ve lined up to host James Snell. The plan is to have James, what’s new in 12, talk and use that for feedback session. 
* Ahmad: I’ve talked to the Toronto JavaScript group about what would they need and what would we help in terms of facilitating 
  such a meeting.
* Tracy: I started creating a guide for this, I already have a blog post in play for speakers who go to meetups and for people
  who want to host meetups. PDX: Michel/open source is willing to host the user feedback for us, he’s waiting for more details, 
  but he’s open to that. 
* Mihai: When is the PDX meet-up?
* Tracy: I ping him on Twitter and asked him when he wanted to do this. 
* Dan: On May 9 it might be a good choice and I can ask James to do that, and I’m happy to come.
* Promises and stronger typing: Michael: Tierney showed interested in stronger typing;once we catch up on the existing list 
  we can   revalidate that somebody’s going to be willing to put together the questions, ask some availability. 
* Invite somebody from Marketing from Foundation for next meeting 
* Ahmad: Target Thursday April 25 for Enterprise meeting, 10 AM Pacific time
