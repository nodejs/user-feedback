**TOPIC**
# Notes
We are approaching 150-160 Benchmarking survey answers. Will be great if by the end of January (end of survey submission) 
will have around 200 (Tierney tweeded, thank you). Pushed on media to get more answers.   
**Thank you Joel** for joining this meeting.

     * One of the challenges is not everyone can be on github and for some users we do not have a real time 
       channel of communication and may be reflected on how to be engaged in Node.js
     * (Joel) Tweeter and Github are working well for the people interested in Node.Js  
     * Join Node.js Slack: http://nodeslackers.com 
     * Enterprise Advisory Group- we are looking at quarterly cadence with a proposal in mind for an on-site meeting,
       to learn how our large installs of Node.js are being used and provide direct feedback from those individuals.
       At this point probably it will be beginning of March.
     * Add meeting template (ref: #28 (comment))  
     * (Tierney)-create the issue for the next meeting automatically : there are 4 different types of files.
       Mihai will create a PR and will work on this 
     * Index 2018 Moscone West, San Francisco
     * 2018-02-09 Public User Feedback Meeting: since the Benchmarking WG will not have time 
       to digest the results of the survey, focus on why to questions were asked and what 
       the WG will try to accomplish and the potential direction we are looking for.
