## Agenda

## Announcements

* Extracted from **user-feedback-meeting** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/user-feedback

* Public User Feedback request - European General User Feedback at WorkerConf [#56](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues/56)

* Invite Node.js tooling ecosystem folks to discuss user feedback [#37](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues/37)

### Notes: Intro by Dan
* Get ready for Node.Js collaborator summit Europe edition next week and we will have a Public User Session in Austria, 
  hosted by  Benedikt from Google from v8 team lead. We will need to document some things.
* Share thoughts from Dan: invite folks to put questions; have a brainstorming for next tooling meeting;
* Michael: If you hear the people asking particular things post them into that issue.
* @yhwang and Michael are coordinating the group formed nodejs/embedding team 
* We would like to have Chris to have a cadence with tooling. Action: Michael will reach Chris and talk about this. If he’s got the
  cyles to kind of sort of drive the organization part that would be good.
* Next meeting on 06.08.2018 we are hosting public tooling
* Enterprise: still on going. Coming with a propose for the next session. Most of the communication is by email
  and the repo. (Tierney: we have an email list like from about 7 months ago, at least we should dig after that). 
  Once the next week it’s over (summit) we will think more about this. Reach out to @ahmadnassri, hand out the list of
  contacts and to set up the next meeting? Issue [#66](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues/66)
