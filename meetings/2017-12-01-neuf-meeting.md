## Notes

**Supporting the Node.js 2018 User Survey (ref: #8 )**
- [MikeH] Request previous year's data from the Foundation to be able to explore trend data.
- [MikeH] Issue created around getting survey results (ref: #14)
- [Dawson] We should make supporting the Annual Node.js Foundation survey a mandate of NEUF.
- [Tierney] The Annual Node.js User Survey is announced and launched each year at Node.js Interactive. The next Node.js User Survey will be launched at JS Interactive in October 2018.
- [dshaw] Let's reach out to Greg Wallace and invite him to attend the next meeting (on 2017-12-15).

**Bench-marking team request for survey (ref: nodejs/community-committee#153)**
- [dshaw] We should see if Greg Wallace could help to create a survey for Benchmarking using Foundation infrastructure (esp. Survey Monkey account).
- [Tierney] We should include Zibby Keaton as well.
- [dshaw] Let's invite both Greg Wallace and Zibby Keaton to the next NEUF meeting.
- [MikeH] As we create online surveys, let's keep in mind our goals to be able to do face-to-face outreach and support data collection from face-to-face sessions.
- [Dawson] It would be nice to get the survey input process started in 2017. Can we launch before the end of the year
- [dshaw] I'm happy to to meet with Greg prior to the next meeting to accelerate the process. Dawson and Tierney to join.

**Initial Users for feedback meetings (ref: #12)**
- [Dawson] I'd like to invite some local companies from Toronto to provide feedback. Are we ready to kick off sessions?
- [dshaw] To be respectful of everyone's time, what if we alternate organizational meetings with public outreach sessions during the bi-weekly cadence of the user-feedback meetings.
- [Dawson] We don't have to do it too frequently. Perhaps b-monthly.
- [dshaw] Let's target February 9th for the initial session.
- [Dawson] I'll create an issue to track this and point folks to.

**Closing Thoughts**
- [Kapke] Is this initiative interested in supporting feedback and outreach to Node.js users/companies who are evaluating Node.js?
- [dshaw] Very much interested in supporting potential Node.js adopters. In fact, I was just in France helping a major insurance provider kick off their selection and adoption of Node.js. I'm sure I could invite folks from that organization to share about that journey.
- [dshaw] We could invite folks to discuss this at the January 12th meeting.
