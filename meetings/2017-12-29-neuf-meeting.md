## Notes

**TOPIC**
- Benchmarking Working Group survey

Benchmarking WG requested survey in October.
Live now at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NodeBenchmarking
Data is hosted by the Node.js Foundation (NF) with the help of Greg Wallace. NEUF team will request data from NF.


**Closing Thoughts**
- Next meeting is slated for 2017-01-12 and was going to be the first public, recorded End User Feedback session. Kapke wanted to organize a session with "New Node.js Users, plus Users Choosing Node.js now", but will be unable to attend. We'll hold a regular meeting and continue survey data collection, then hold the first public feedback session in February.
