# Node.js End User Feedback Initiative

We are in the formative steps of building out infrastructure, process and collaborators to bring large-scale feedback to the Node.js project under the charter of the [Node.js Community Committee (CommComm)](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee). Thank you for your interest and support. We are actively looking for new members. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues) in this repo if you are interested in dedicating 5+ hours a month to during the formation process. We expect the formation process to run through Q2 2018. The primary skillset for this initiative is largely non-technical: social sciences, product and project management and organizational.

## What does the Node.js End User Feedback team do?
The Node.js End User Feedback team works with Node.js end users to provide a bi-directional feedback channel for the Node.js project through surveys, meetings and outreach.

### Projects
* In-person and online end user feedback sessions. [We want to hear from you!](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback#end-user-feedback---looking-for-participants)
* Support the annual Node.js User Survey launched every year at Node.js Interactive (usually in October) by the Node.js Foundation. We provide input on questions and intend to publish copies of the data for analysis.
* Support [CommComm](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) and [TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) end user feedback and outreach needs.
  - We are currently preparing the [2017 Benchmarking WG Survey](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues/22) for the [Benchmarking WG](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking).
* Manage the [Enterprise Advisory Group](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues/18) to the TSC.

## End User Feedback - Looking for Participants :tada:

The Node.js end user feedback team (NEUF) will be working to gather feedback from end users through a number of different channels.

One of those channels will be live discussion either in person or on-line. We are starting to put together a list of businesses who:

* are using Node.js for their production systems
* use Node.js as part of their tooling
* are evaluating Node.js as a potential technology
* have recently chosen Node.js and are just getting started
* would like to use Node.js but face obstacles in being able to do so

If you would like to get involved and participate regularly (currently thinking is every 2 months or quarterly)
please email user-feedback@nodejs.org.
