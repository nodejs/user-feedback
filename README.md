# Node.js End User Feedback Initiative

We are in the formative steps of building out infrastructure, process and collaborators to bring large-scale feedback to the Node.js project under the charter of the [Node.js Community Committee (CommComm)](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee). Thank you for your interest and support. We are actively looking for new members. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues) in this repo if you are interested in dedicating 5+ hours a month to during the formation process. We expect the formation process to run through Q2 2018. The primary skillset for this initiative is largely non-technical: social sciences, product and project management and organizational.

## What does the Node.js End User Feedback team do?
The Node.js End User Feedback team works with Node.js end users to provide a bi-directional feedback channel for the Node.js project through surveys, meetings and outreach.

### Projects

* Support [CommComm](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) and [TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) end user feedback and outreach needs.
