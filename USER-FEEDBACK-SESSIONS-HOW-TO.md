# Node.js User Feedback Sessions: A Guide

## Announcing Node.js User Feedback Sessions

The ultimate goals of the Node.js User Feedback Sessions are to:

- Facilitate connections between the wider network of Node.js contributors and users
- Encourage Node.js users to contribute back to the ecosystem by showing them how
- Create a feedback loop for Node.js users to know where to send feedback on release and upgrade issues and package problems.

We want to know how our community is doing and how we can provide users with everything they need to succeed.


## What is a Node.js User Feedback Session and Who Runs Them?

If you are an organizer or speaker of a Node.js meetup, this is a guide on how to run a Node.js user feedback session.

User feedback sessions can either be run as part of a meetup or as a standalone meetup.

The user feedback sessions take approximately 60 minutes and are complemented by slides focused on topics such as Node.js recent updates or releases. These slides will be provided to you as well.

At these sessions, we are hoping that organizers and speakers will provide help and facilitate learning on how users can submit feedback to problems they are having with Node.js. 

## How to Run a Node.js User Feedback Session - Getting Started

** Agree to Run a User Feedback Session **

Does helping people interest you? That’s the first question you should be asking yourself. If the answer is yes, running a session is the job for you! 

- If you run a local meetup, post your meetup on meetup.com to get started.
- If you don’t run your local meetup, then find a local meetup that will host you as a speaker for this user feedback session. If you would like, you can augment the user feedback session with a talk on Node.js as well! This is highly encouraged.
- Tell the Node.js User Feedback Group that you are running a session
- Use the [issue template](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) labeled User Feedback Session to create an issue
- Post it as an issue under [issues](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues)
- Review session materials and where to find help
-- We have created session materials for you that you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10ps715QthCsdTE_YmIRvfbYZC8onhQ7fPvlaYVISBAA/edit#slide=id.g50adb52472_0_25). 
-- Have questions? Create an issue in the repo [here](https://github.com/nodejs/mentorship/issues) so we can help!

## During the Node.js User Feedback Session - Running the Session

- Use the introduction slides found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10ps715QthCsdTE_YmIRvfbYZC8onhQ7fPvlaYVISBAA/edit#slide=id.g50adb52472_0_25) (WIP).
- Introduce the structure of the project and where people can get feedback
- Introducing the project will be by way of opening an issue on GitHub underneath and having people submit PR’s.
- What are questions and/or problems that anyone may have?
- Gain insight on questions or concerns members may have and brainstorm on solutions.
- Share your screen and show people directly where to submit an issue to ask questions
- Repository where they should submit issues: https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues
- Add comments to the issue as people are talking while sharing your screen to show people how to do it and submit feedback directly.
- Sharing your screen is important so they’re able to visually see the steps to take. Screen-recording the session so people can look back to it is good for their notes as well.
- Allow others to open their screens and submit feedback
- Practice makes perfect! Ensure members not to be scared or feel put on the spot as everything is a learning process and you’re there to help!
- Tell people they can do this ongoing
- Even after the meetup is over they’re able to submit feedback through the repository, ongoing. Make that clear.

## After the Event - What’s Next?

- Tell us how it went and the feedback in an issue
- Tell us what additional support you need
- Do another one
- Afterwards user feedback people will comment on that issue and ask for specific feedback
