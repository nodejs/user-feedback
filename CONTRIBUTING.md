This is an adapted version from Contributing.md file used by Community-Committee https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

## Vocabulary

* A **Contributor** is any individual gathering data, performing outreach, feedback collection, organizing meetings, organizing events, taking notes or providing written feedback. As much as possible, we try to capture attribution of these actions with an [issue](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/pulls).
* A **Collaborator** is a **_Contributor_** who has been given write access to the repository.
* A **Member** is a **_Collaborator_** with voting rights who has met the requirements of participation to be considered for acceptance, and subsequently voted in using the Node.js CommComm voting process.

-You may start to take a look at any issues (https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues).

# Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes
to documentation, code, binary files, etc. 
No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no collaborator has an objection.
During review collaborators may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a
particular area gives a "LGTM" before the PR can be merged. There is no additional "sign off"
process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by collaborators are addressed it can
be landed by any collaborator.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another collaborator, all involved
collaborators should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed
by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.

# Becoming a Member and Collaborator

We are still working to better define the ladder to becoming a full member. The work of User Feedback is primarily non-technical in nature. Given the norms of the Node.js project we still attribute that work through GitHub issues and pull requests.

We would love your contribution and will help you become a collaborator and member.
Start by joining our bi-weekly meetings. Please [post an issue](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues) introducing yourself.

After attending 3 Node.js End User Feedback (NEUF) meetings and becoming a **Contributor**, you will be eligible to become a **Collaborator**.

After 3 months in good standing as a **Contributor**, you will be eligible to become a **Collaborator**.
