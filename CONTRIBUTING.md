## Vocabulary

# Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes
to documentation, code, binary files, etc. 
No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no collaborator has an objection.
During review collaborators may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a
particular area gives a "LGTM" before the PR can be merged. There is no additional "sign off"
process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by collaborators are addressed it can
be landed by any collaborator.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another collaborator, all involved
collaborators should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed
by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.
